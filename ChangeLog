	* Version 0.5.5
	* The size of the back end editor area may be configured in User TSConfig. See the configuration section. Thanks to Peter Enzenberger.
	* In Mozilla/Firefox, url's and email's are automatically transformed into links as soon as they are followed by a space; hitting escape or ctrl-z before any other key unlinks the text. Thanks to Xinha.

	* Improved memory management and reduced memory leakage.
	* Correction: the cellinsertafter button was incorrectly configured in the default configuration.

	* Correction: the path to default skin component htmlarea-edited-content.css was incorrectly set.
	* When the configuration variable Enable Mozilla/Firefox extension is enabled, if the client browser is Firefox 1+, the installation of the Firefox extension AllowClipboard Helper will triggered instead of the extension generated by this TYPO3 extension.
	* In Mozilla/Firefox, an exception will be raised only when performing a paste with the tool bar button. Pasting with ctrl-v key will not raise any exception. Thanks to Guillaume Crico.

	* Correction: when TYPO3 is not installed in the web server's root path, the dynamiccss.css file was not properly included. Thanks to Johannes Bornhold for this correction.
	* Correction for IE: on some Windows platforms, the display of the window status bar cannot be avoided unless the script is granted some privileges; in such cases, the height of the resized popup windows was insufficient; the resizing algorithm has been revised in order to correct this situation.
